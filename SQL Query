# AMER_Case-Study
This is the SQL Query that analyze the American Energy Market Regulator and identify the providers, outages, emergency status, their reasons and fixing times. The organization of this information let us see key insights that later in the tableau presentation helped to provide more accuarete details about the American Market Energy Regulator (AMER). 

PART I
Energy Stability and Market Outages

1) What are the most common outage types?

/* Question 1.1: In the AEMR dataset, write a SQL statement that COUNTS the number of valid (i.e. Status = Approved) outage events for 2016. This should be grouped by and ordered by the outage reason.*/

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, 
  Status, 
  Reason 
FROM AEMR 
WHERE Status = "Approved" AND YEAR(Start_Time) = "2016"
GROUP BY Reason ORDER BY Total_Number_Outage_Events DESC;

/* Question 1.2: Which outage type occurred most frequently in 2016? */ 
  *** a) Forced ****
  b) Consequential
  c) Scheduled (Planned)
  d) Opportunistic Maintenance (Planned)
  
/* Question 1.3: Write a SQL statement to COUNT the number of valid (i.e. Status = Approved) outage events sorted by their reason (i.e. Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic)* for 2017. */ 
  
SELECT
	 Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,
   Status, 
   Reason
FROM AEMR
WHERE
	Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2017
GROUP BY Status, Reason ORDER BY Reason;

/* Question 1.4: Which outage type occurred the least in 2017?
  a) Forced
  b) Consequential
  c) Scheduled (Planned)
  *** d) Opportunistic Maintenance (Planned) ***
  
/* Question 1.5: Write a SQL statement that calculates the average duration in days rounded to 2 decimal places for each approved outage type across both 2016 and 2017. Don't forget to Order this by Reason and Year. */

SELECT
  Status,
  Reason,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, 
  ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/1440), 2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days, 
  Year
FROM AEMR 
WHERE Status = "Approved" AND Year(Start_Time) = "2016" OR Year(Start_Time) = "2017"
GROUP BY Reason, Year ORDER BY Reason, Year;

2) How frequently do outages occur?

/* Question 2.1: Write a SQL statement showing the monthly COUNT of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred for 2016. Order by Reason and Month. */

SELECT
	Status
	,Reason
	,Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events
	,Month(Start_Time) as Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time) = 2016
GROUP BYStatus, Reason, Month(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Month;

/* Question 2.2: Write a SQL Statement showing the monthly COUNT of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred during 2017. Order by Reason and Month. */

SELECT
	Status,
	Reason,
	Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,
	Month(Start_Time) as Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time) = 2017
GROUP BYStatus, Reason, Month(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Month;

Question 2.3: Write a SQL statement showing the total number of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred for both 2016 and 2017 per month (i.e. 1 – 12). Don't forget to Order this by by Month and Year.

SELECT
	Status,
	Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,
	Month(Start_Time) as Month,
	Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY
	Status,
	Month(Start_Time),
	Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Month(Start_Time);

3) Are there any energy providers that have more outages than their peers that may be indicative of being unreliable?

/* Question 3.1: Write a SQL statement showing the count of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) for all participant codes for 2016 and 2017. Order by Year and Participant_Code. */

SELECT
	Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,
	Participant_Code,
	Status,
	Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Participant_Code;

/* Question 3.2: Write a SQL statement showing the average duration of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) for all participant codes from 2016 to 2017. Don't forget to order the average duration in descending order with the DESC keyword. */

SELECT
	Participant_Code
	,Status
	,Year(Start_Time) as Year
	,ROUND(AVG((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days DESC;

Part II
When an energy provider provides energy to the market, they are making a commitment to the market and saying; “We will supply X amount of energy to the market under a contractual obligation.” However, in a situation where the outages are forced, the energy provider intended to provide energy but is unable to provide energy and is forced offline. If many energy providers are forced offline at the same time, it could cause an energy security risk that AEMR needs to mitigate.

1) Of the outage types in 2016 and 2017, what are the respective percentages composed of Forced Outage(s)?

/* Question 1.1: Write a SQL Statement to COUNT the total number of approved forced outage events for 2016 and 2017. Order by Reason and Year. */

SELECT
	COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
	Reason,
	Year(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND Reason = 'Forced'
GROUP BY Reason, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Year(Start_Time);

/* Question 1.2: Building upon the query you completed in the previous question, calculate the proportion of outages that were forced for both 2016 and 2017. Order from 2016 to 2017. */

SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = "Forced" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Number_Forced_Outage_Events,
	COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
	ROUND(((SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = "Forced" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(*))*100),2) AS Forced_Outage_Percentage,
	Year(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time);

2) What was the average duration for a forced outage during both 2016 and 2017? Have we seen an increase in the average duration of forced outages?

/* Question 2.1: Write a SQL statement to calculate the AVERAGE duration of forced outage events rounded to 2 decimal places, as well as the AVERAGE amount of energy lost (MW) (also rounded to 2 decimal places) for both 2016 and 2017 due to forced outages. Don't forget to order this by YEAR. */

SELECT
  Status,
  Year(Start_Time) AS Year,
  ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
  ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status ='Approved' AND Reason = 'Forced'
GROUP BY Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Status, Year(Start_Time);

/* Question 2.2 Write a SQL statement to compare the AVERAGE duration of each individual outage event (Forced, Consequential, Planned and Opportunistic) for both 2016 and 2017. Order from 2016 to 2017. */

SELECT
  Status,
  Reason,
  Year(Start_Time) AS Year,
  ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
  ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status ='Approved'
GROUP BY Status,Reason, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Status,Reason, Year(Start_Time);

3) Which energy providers tend to be the most unreliable?

/* Question 3.1: Write a SQL Statement to calculate the AVERAGE duration and AVERAGE energy lost (MW) for all approved outages where the reason is equal to Forced for each participant code, Ordered By AVERAGE energy loss (Avg_Outage_MW_Loss) and Year in descending order.*/

SELECT
  Participant_Code,
  Status,
  Year(Start_Time) AS Year,
  ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
  ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60/24), 2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status = "Approved" AND Reason = "Forced"
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Year
ORDER BY Avg_Outage_MW_Loss, Year DESC;

/* Question 3.2: Write a SQL statement to calculate the Average Outage (MW) Loss and Overall Summed Outage (MW) loss for each participant code where the Status is Approved and the Outage Reason is Forced across both 2016 and 2017.

This data extract should be sorted in descending order for Summed_Energy_Lost, and ordered from 2016 to 2017. */

SELECT
  Participant_Code,
  Facility_Code,
  Status,
  Year(Start_Time) AS Year,
  ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
  ROUND(SUM(Outage_MW),2) AS Summed_Energy_Lost
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status = "Approved" AND Reason = "Forced"
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Facility_Code, Status, Year
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Summed_Energy_Lost DESC;
